#+title: Opsview CMDB Sync

* Disclaimer
*ov_cmdb_sync* is pre-release software that is currently under active development.

* Introduction
*ov_cmdb_sync* is a CLI tool that performs a one-way sync from a CMDB to Opsview. It is currently only designed to work with the ServiceNow CMDB, but could in the future be extended to work with other CMDBs.

* Configuration
** ServiceNow
In ServiceNow CMDB, any CI that should monitored by Opsview must have the mandatory text `OpsviewCollectorCluster=<cluster name>` in the `attributes` field. The cluster name is used to determine which Opsview cluster the CI should be assigned to. The cluster name must match the name of a cluster in the Opsview instance that you are syncing to.

The following options are also available to set in the `attributes` field:

- `OpsviewHashtags=<hashtag1>,<hashtag2>,...` - A comma-separated list of hashtags to be applied to the host in Opsview. These hashtags will be applied in addition to the cluster hashtag.

- `OpsviewHostTemplates=<template1>,<template2>,...` - A comma-separated list of host templates to be applied to the host in Opsview.

All of the semicolon-separated options in the `attributes` field need to be in the following format:

#+begin_src text
    OpsviewCollectorCluster=Cluster-01;OpsviewHashtags=hashtag1,hashtag2;OpsviewHostTemplates=template1,"template name with spaces"
#+end_src

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300

This text-based formatting will likely be replaced in the future but works for testing and development purposes.

** Opsview
There is nothing to configure in Opsview.
